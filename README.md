# Word Guess Game 🎮
This is a simple word guess game made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is inspired by the classic hangman game, where you have to guess a word by typing letters before you run out of chances. The game has a fun and colorful interface, and it also ~~plays sound effects and music~~ to enhance the gaming experience. 🎵

## How to play 🕹️
To play the game, you need to open the index.html file in your browser. You will see a screen with a random word that is hidden by underscores. You have to type letters on your keyboard in the input box or use the onscreen keyboard to guess the word. If you guess a correct letter, it will be revealed in the word. If you guess a wrong letter, you will lose one chance. You have chances depending on length os word, to guess. If you guess the word before you run out of chances. ~~You can restart the game at any time by clicking the reset button. 🔁~~

## How it works 💻
The game is powered by JavaScript, which handles the logic and functionality of the game. The game uses an array of words that are randomly selected for each round. The game uses HTML and CSS to create the layout and style of the game. The game uses DOM manipulation to update the elements on the screen based on the user input and the game state.

## Upcoming Features 🌟

#### The game has will have features soon that make it more enjoyable and challenging, such as:

* A hint button that gives you a clue about the word. You can use it once per round, but it will cost you one chance. 💡

* A difficulty level that you can choose before starting the game. 

    * The difficulty level affects the number of words in the array, the length of the words, and the number of chances you have. 

    * You can choose between easy, medium, and hard modes. 🌶️

    * A leaderboard that shows your best scores for each difficulty level.
