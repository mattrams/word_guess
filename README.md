# Word Guess Game 🎮
This is a simple word guess game made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is inspired by the classic hangman game, where you have to guess a word by typing letters before you run out of chances. The game has a fun and colorful interface, and it also plays sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience. 🎵

## How to play 🕹️
To play the game, you need to open the index.html file in your browser. You will see a screen with a random word that is hidden by underscores. You have to type letters on your keyboard to guess the word. If you guess a correct letter, it will be revealed in the word. If you guess a wrong letter, it will be added to the wrong guesses list, and you will lose one chance. You have 10 chances to guess the word. If you guess the word before you run out of chances, you win the game and get a congratulatory message. If you run out of chances, you lose the game and get a game over message. You can also see your score and the number of words you have guessed correctly at the top of the screen. You can restart the game at any time by clicking the reset button. 🔁

## How it works 💻
The game is powered by JavaScript, which handles the logic and functionality of the game. The game uses an array of words that are randomly selected for each round. The game also uses an object to store the sound effects and music that are played during the game. The game uses HTML and CSS to create the layout and style of the game. The game uses DOM manipulation to update the elements on the screen based on the user input and the game state.

## Upcoming Features 🌟
The game has some features that make it more enjoyable and challenging, such as:

A timer that counts down from 60 seconds for each round. If you don’t guess the word within the time limit, you lose the game. ⏱️

A hint button that gives you a clue about the word. You can use it once per round, but it will cost you one chance. 💡

A difficulty level that you can choose before starting the game. 

The difficulty level affects the number of words in the array, the length of the words, and the number of chances you have. 

You can choose between easy, medium, and hard modes. 🌶️

A leaderboard that shows your best scores for each difficulty level.

You can see your rank, score, and number of words guessed correctly for each mode. 
 
You can also reset your scores if you want to start over. 🏆
